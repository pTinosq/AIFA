# AIFA
AIFA stands for Argumentation Is F***ing Awesome. I can't think of another name so it will have to do.

## Running the server locally
1. Create a Python virtual environment

```
2. Install all requirement
```
venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Server should be running on localhost:5000 by default.
